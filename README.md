Rust Implementation of MiniGPT - Training GPT-2 (CPU, fp32) in Rust as lightweight as possible

We've all seen Andrej Karpathy's famous (or infamous!) minigpt project at https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT for python.

Here we're building a simple and fast implementation of miniGPT that will reproduce GPT-2 level using rust.  The aim is to build something that can iterate the training loop fast in as little lines of code as possible.  Lets go!!

Note: Still learning Rust, so any comments, improvements, or criticisms are welcome!
